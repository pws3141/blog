    "text": "Genetics for dummys\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nBefore diving in, it’s worth remarking that the field of genetics was created before anyone had any idea about the structure of a cell, what DNA looked like, and what chromosomes were. This means the language around this topic can be somewhat confusing for a newcomer, as old terms are still floating around, and overlapping with newer more precise terms.\n\n\nLet’s start by describing the basic mechanics of genetic material and cells. In humans, most cell contains DNA, which is packaged in 23 chromosomes2. DNA is a long code created from four nucleotides – adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), and thymine (T) – which are paired with each other (AT and CG) to create base pairs. Parts of the DNA do a specific job, and are known as genes. These genes either code for proteins, or help control other genes. Genes are small sections of DNA that have the ability to be copied into an RNA sequence, which can then encode for proteins (or perform other tasks).\n2 by being tightly coiled around proteins known as histones3 The full table showing these combinations can be seen hereA single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is when there is a substitution in a single nucleotide. A SNP in a gene can create differences within populations, for example in the ability to metabolise alcohol. Most of the time, however, they do not create any differences, as when the RNA from genes are read, they are done in codons. A codon is a set of three base pairs, and therefore there are \\(4^3 = 64\\) different combinations of the four nucleotides (\\(61\\) of which specify amino acids). However, as there are only \\(20\\) amino acids, there are many codons with different base pairs that produce the same amino acids. For example, UCU, UCC, UCA, UCG, AGU, AGC all produce the Serine amino acid.3\n\nA short history\nLets start with Gregor Mendel – the “father of modern genetics” and well known for his experiments into the inheritance of pea plants. I won’t go into detail on him, as Wikipedia can do that for me. However, two quick points to make:\n\nThe Laws of Inheritance are important pre-requisite conditions for Mendelian Randomisation to work.\nThe genius of Mendel was his ability to understand that the underlying process was random, and he was only observing a realisation of this random process.\n\nThe double-helix structure of DNA was discovered by Rosalind Franklin, James Watson and Francis Crick in 1953. This knowledge of the structure allowed the further discoveries of how proteins are translated from RNA, which is transcribed by DNA.\n\nBiobanks\nIn the last twenty years or so, large biobanks have been created. These store the genetic and health information of individuals, either at a single point in time or with a temporal aspect. Two examples of large biobanks are:\n\nThe UK Biobank has information on around half-a-million individuals aged between 40 and 69.\nThe Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. Here, more than 14,000 pregnant women were recruited into the study in 1991/92, with their children, and grandchildren, being followed up in detail.\n\nOne important caveat for these biobanks when using them for research is that they are not representative of the population of the UK. For example, it is known that the individuals in the UK Biobank are more likely to be in a higher social-economic bracket, with fewer lung cancers and other health issues than the general population. This makes performing analysis and obtaining generalisable result (using GWAS4 and Mendelian Randomisation) more difficult.\n4 genome-wise association studies\n\nGenome-wise associated studies\nGenome-wide association studies (GWAS) attempt to find associations between genetic variants and phenotypes. The genetic variants considered are usually SNPs, as opposed to indels5. As biobank sequencing is normally short-read (i.e. only a small section of DNA is read at a time) and the location of these short-reads are random,6 it is trickier to notice indels compared to SNPs. It is also worth noting here that when an individual’s genome is sequenced, the result isn’t the sequence of DNA in a specific cell, but instead is an average. This means that the SNPs in the sequences obtained were present in most of the cells within the individual so most likely have been there since the very early cell division stages. Therefore, if certain SNPs are associated with phenotypes, then the relationship can be thought of a “lifetime” association.\n5 insertions and deletions6 I am not sure if they are truly random along the whole of the DNA - it might just be that there is some uncertainty in the exact location"

    "text": "Adding accessibility\nHere we assume the visually aspects of the graph are accessible.3 In this section I will add the following capabilities to the graph.\n3 This is probably a big assumption. I am assuming the following information given by the Government Analysis Function (which apply to static charts) has been applied:\n\nGuidance on designing charts.\nGuidance on the use of colour. For alternative colour palettes, consider Paul Tol’s notes\n\n\nThe ability to download the data;\nKeyboard navigation;\nAlt text, following guidance given by Amy Cesal in her blog post, “Writing Alt Text for Data Visualization”.\n\n\nExporting the data\nFirst, lets try and include a menu to export the data and the plot as an image – this requires using a module. Examples of using modules and plug-ins4 in {highcharter} are given in the modules vignette.\n4 I’m not sure what the difference is between a ‘module’ and a ‘plug-in’, except that the ‘.js’ files seem to live in different folders.\n\nCode\nhc_penguins2 &lt;- hc_penguins |&gt;\n  #hc_add_dependency(name = \"modules/exporting.js\") |&gt; \n  #hc_add_dependency(name = \"modules/export-data.js\") |&gt; \n  hc_exporting(\n    enabled = TRUE,\n    filename = \"palmer_penguins\"\n  )\n\nhc_penguins2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComment on hc_add_dependency\n\n\n\nIn the quartoandme blog, the following lines are included in the ‘working example’:\n  hc_add_dependency(name = \"modules/accessibility.js\") |&gt; \n  hc_add_dependency(name = \"modules/exporting.js\") |&gt; \n  hc_exporting(\n    enabled = TRUE\n  )\nBut, (I think) the hc_exporting() function automatically includes the exporting.js and export-data.js modules when enabled = TRUE, so the two hc_add_dependency calls are unnecessary. I’m willing to be proved wrong here.\n\n\n\n\nKeyboard navigation\nTo get keyboard navigation working, we need to use the accessibility Highchart module.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequired changes to {highcharter} v0.9.4\n\n\n\nIf using v0.9.4 of {highcharter}, then copying the code below will result in no plot being output. This is a known issue, and is discussed in the GitHub repo issue 755.\nThere are two ways to fix this issue:\n\nUncomment the accessibility module in the ‘highcharts.yaml’ file.5 On my Mac, this is found at /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.4-arm64/Resources/library/highcharter/htmlwidgets (for your computer, use .libPaths() to find the default path for packages).

But, as discussed in the Highcharts accessibility documentation,\n\nNote: Since Highcharts now supports captions and linked descriptions, it is preferred to define the description using those methods, as a visible caption/description benefits all users.

Then, then the linkedDescription option in hc_chart(accessibility = ...) connects the chart to the &lt;div&gt; by its ID.\n\n\nIf accessibility.description is also defined in the chart, it will override the linked description, as mentioned in the documentation.\n\n\nCode\n# Add an external description for the chart\ndescription_id &lt;- \"chart-description\"\n\ncat(sprintf(\n  '&lt;div id=\"%s\"&gt;\n    A scatter plot displays the relationship between bill length (mm) on the y-axis \n    and flipper length (mm) on the x-axis for three penguin species: Adelie, Chinstrap, \n    and Gentoo.
