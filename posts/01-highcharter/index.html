<p>Inspired by the <a href="https://quartoand.me/blog/2021-11_adventures-with-the-highcharts-accessibility-module-part-1/">quarto and me blog</a>, I am looking into using <a href="https://jkunst.com/highcharter/">{highcharter}</a> <span class="citation" data-cites="kunst2022highcharter">(<a href="#ref-kunst2022highcharter" role="doc-biblioref">Kunst 2022</a>)</span>.

<li>Is accessible, following advice given by the <a href="https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/accessibility-legislation-what-you-need-to-know/">Government Analysis Function</a></li>

<p>In the <a href="https://quartoand.me/blog/2021-11_adventures-with-the-highcharts-accessibility-module-part-1/#highcharts-accessibility">quartoandme blog</a>, the following lines are included in the ‘working example’:</p>

<p>But, (I think) the <code>hc_exporting()</code> function automatically includes the <code>exporting.js</code> and <code>export-data.js</code> modules when <code>enabled = TRUE</code>, so the two <code>hc_add_dependency</code> calls are unnecessary. I’m willing to be proved wrong here.</p>

<p>If using v0.9.4 of {highcharter}, then copying the code below will result in no plot being output. This is a known issue, and is discussed in the GitHub repo issue <a href="https://github.com/jbkunst/highcharter/issues/755">755</a>.</p>
<p>There are two ways to fix this issue:</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="using-highchart-accessibility-description">Using Highchart accessibility description</h4>
<p>The simple way to include this alt-text in the plot would be to use the <code>hc_chart()</code> function with the <code>accessibility.description</code> option set to equal <code>alt_text_penguins</code>. But, as discussed in the Highcharts accessibility <a href="https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/accessibility.description">documentation</a>,</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Note: Since Highcharts now supports captions and linked descriptions, it is preferred to define the description using those methods, as a visible caption/description benefits all users. If the <code>accessibility.description</code> option is defined, the linked description is ignored, and the caption is hidden from screen reader users.</p>

    A scatter plot displays the relationship between bill length (mm) on the y-axis 
    and flipper length (mm) on the x-axis for three penguin species: Adelie, Chinstrap, 
    and Gentoo. Each species is represented by a different colour: dark blue for Adelie, 
    teal for Chinstrap, and burgundy for Gentoo. Gentoo penguins have the largest flipper 
    and bill lengths, forming a distinct cluster towards the upper right of the graph. 
    Adelie penguins have smaller flipper and bill lengths, clustering at the lower left, 
    while Chinstrap penguins are positioned between the other two species. 
    The chart highlights that Gentoo penguins have notably large flippers.
  &lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
