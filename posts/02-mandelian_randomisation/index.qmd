## Introduction

In the previous few weeks I have been trying to learn about Mendelian Randomisation, which has resulted in me doing a whistle-stop tour around genetics, codons, and genetic-wide association studies (GWAS). This post is a collection of my notes and thoughts.^[Please let me know if there are any mistakes or misconceptions]

## Genetics for dummys

::: {.callout-note}
Before diving in, it's worth remarking that the field of genetics was created before anyone had any idea about the structure of a cell, what DNA looked like, and what chromosomes were. This means the language around this topic can be somewhat confusing for a newcomer, as old terms are still floating around, and overlapping with newer more precise terms.
:::

Let's start by describing the basic mechanics of genetic material and cells. In
humans, most cell contains DNA, which is packaged in 23 chromosomes^[by being
tightly coiled around proteins known as histones]. DNA is a long code created
from four nucleotides -- adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), and thymine (T) --
which are paired with each other (AT and CG) to create base pairs. Parts of the
DNA do a specific job, and are known as genes. These genes either code for
proteins, or help control other genes. Genes are small sections of DNA that
have the ability to be copied into an RNA sequence, which can then encode for
proteins (or perform other tasks).

A single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is when there is a substitution in a single nucleotide.
A SNP in a gene can create differences within populations, for example in the
ability to metabolise alcohol. Most of the time, however, they do not create
any differences, as when the RNA from genes are read, they are done in codons.
A codon is a set of three base pairs, and therefore there are $2^4 = 64$
different combinations of the four nucleotides ($61$ of which specify amino
acids). However, as there are only $20$ amino acids, there are many codons with
different bae pairs that produce the same amino acids. For example, UCU, UCC,
UCA, UCG, AGU, AGC all produce the Serine amino acid.^[The full table showing
these combinations can be seen

### A short history

TODO: 

- Gregor Mendel: "recessive" and "dominant" 
- The birth of genetics: 1900 - 1940, basic patterns of genetic inheritance
- DNA (1940s and 50s), and the discovery of the double helix (Rosalind Franklin, James Watson and Francis Crick, 1953)
- Biobanks
- GWAS

Lets start with Gregor Mendel, as he is the "father of modern genetics". I won't go into detail on him, as [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregor_Mendel) can do that for me. However, two quick points to make:

1. The [*Laws of Inheritance*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mendelian_inheritance#Mendel's_laws_of_inheritance) are important pre-requisite conditions for Mendelian Randomisation to work.
2. The genius of Mendel was his ability to understand that the underlying process was random and he was only observing a realisation of this random process.
