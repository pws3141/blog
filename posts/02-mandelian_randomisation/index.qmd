## Introduction

In the previous few weeks I have been trying to learn about Mendelian Randomisation, which has resulted in me doing a whistle-stop tour around genetics, codons, and genetic-wide association studies (GWAS). This post is a collection of my notes and thoughts.^[Please let me know if there are any mistakes or misconceptions]

## Genetics for dummys

::: {.callout-note}
Before diving in, it's worth remarking that the field of genetics was created before anyone had any idea about the structure of a cell, what DNA looked like, and what chromosomes were. This means the language around this topic can be somewhat confusing for a newcomer, as old terms are still floating around, and overlapping with newer more precise terms.

### A short history

TODO: 

- Gregor Mendel: "recessive" and "dominant" 
- The birth of genetics: 1900 - 1940, basic patterns of genetic inheritance
- DNA (1940s and 50s), and the discovery of the double helix (Rosalind Franklin, James Watson and Francis Crick, 1953)
- Biobanks
- GWAS
